   <p>The problem with polluted water is that people are not able to drink polluted water because it could cause them to get severely sick and could die. We need to clean up or waters to let other people be able to cleanly drink the water. When we clean up our waters we are not only cleaning drinking water for humans but also for animals too. The water we clean up would also help the animals that live in the water for example ocean to be able to love in a clean economy. What we need to do is watch what we are putting in our environment and to go out into the environment and clean up the trash in the waters and land. </p>
       <p>The problem is that the waters of the ocean, lakes, etc. are contaminated with trash and pollution. There is also the problem of when you walk your dog and the dog takes a dump, that stuff is getting stuck in the sewers and drains. Because of all, the dog's dump got stuck in the drains and because that dump will get the water filthy and undrinkable. And that water is not able to be drunk. There are also problems with gasoline. When for example the government drills into the ocean for gasoline that in turn filthy and not suitable for drinking and or for all of the animals that live in that water. </p> 
        <p>Solutions to Unclean and Inaccessible Water</p>
        <p>As one of the leading world issues in the twenty-first century, there have been many solutions to the unclean and Inaccessible water issue. This post covers a few of the best solutions to the problem of world-wide accessible water.</p>
        <p>1. SONO arsenic filters</p>
        <p>Arsenic and metal contaminants in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have seeped out of the soil and into the water supplies, making drinking water poisonous to the inhabitants. SONO filters, created in the late 90s by Abul Hussam, strains unclean water through a bucket containing sand, charcoal, brick chips, and a composite iron matrix to remove the contaminants. One bucket, producing enough clean water per day for a family of five, lasts fourteen years and only costs $35 USD.</p>

        <TEXT STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:900px; LEFT:20px;" <p>2. Solar Stills</p>
        <p>Solar stills use evaporation to distill water. They are favorable because they filter out both contaminants and salt (salt water). They are also very durable and last a very long time. The only thing needed for operation is sunlight, a concept that has been used in water distillation since the mid-1500s. Modern solar stills can produce .8 liters of clean water an hour, but the downside of this is that water can only be filtered during daylight hours.</p>

        <TEXT STYLE="position:relative; TOP:350px; LEFT:0px;" <p>3. Bicycle Water Purifiers</p>
        <p>Bicycle water purifiers are very effective solutions to Unclean water problems, as they transport and decontaminate water all in one. They were developed by a Japanese company, Niphon Basic. With this, a person can ride to a source of water that is farther away and collects water while decontaminating it. By pedaling the bike for less than a minute, you can produce enough drinking water for yourself for an entire day! It is very useful for regions where it is hard to find a water source, as the user can get there faster and easier. The bicycle purifier is not an economical solution yet, as they cost $6,600 each, but Niphon Basics is working to change that and to be able to offer these bikes to people in Bangladesh at a low cost.</p>

        <TEXT STYLE="position:relative; TOP:250px; LEFT:0px;" <p>4. Filter Straws</p>
        <p>Life Straws, a portable water filtration device that can be used like a straw, were developed in Denmark in the early 2000s. These filters decontaminate water of 99.99% of bacteria and parasites. They are also one of the cheaper solutions on this list, a little over $40 USD. Each straw can filter about 1000 liters of water before needing to be replaced.</p>

        <TEXT STYLE="position:relative; TOP:250px; LEFT:0px;" <p>5. Desalination</p>
        <p>Desalination is one of the first forms of water purification. It basically means ridding the water of toxins and contaminants. It is most commonly done through the reverse osmosis-driving water through filter cartridges that trap salt and contaminants. </p>

        <p>The Drinkable Book</p> 
        <p>Did you know that a book could turn contaminated water into the stuff you get from your faucet? Well, Dr. Theresa Dankovich from Carnegie Mellon has made that a reality. A lot of people without access to clean water sources do not actually know that their water is not clean. They have never known any different, so they assume that their infected and murky water is normal. Dr. Dankovich, in partnership with WATERisLIFE{insert link on words}, is trying to change that reality. By using the pages as water filters, people in severe clean water need can now have safe water for up to four years. The book serves to both clean the contaminants out of the water and educate the people of these areas about clean water and the effects of unclean water. </p>
        <p>Other reading about the Drinkable Book:</p>
        <p>Reducing Water Consumption</p>
        <p>Many people in Africa cannot even get 20 liters of water a day. This may not seem like a problem, but to show you how little than actually is, Europeans use an average of 150 liters a day, and Americans quadruple that at 600 liters a day. Much of this water consumption is wasted water. Long showers, baths, leaving the faucet on, etc. all contribute to this waste of a resource that many of us take advantage of. Almost 2 million children die annually, because they don’t have access to clean water. 1.1 billion people worldwide don’t have access to clean water. Almost 2.5 times that many people don’t have access to proper plumbing, contributing to the water contamination. In a world where water is being wasted, this is unacceptable. We all know how schools and ads tell you to use less water in your daily life. Maybe you listen for a few days, a week. But, you eventually return to old habits. This has to stop. People in developed countries are desensitized to the fact that not everybody has access to water. They’ve never known any different. We all need to change our habits and be aware that this is a real problem that people face every day. No one should have to wonder daily if they can find enough water for them and their families to survive. For many, their entire day every day is centered around collecting enough water for basic tasks and drinking. The developed countries of the world have an obligation to help those in need, because water is the most basic necessity of life and a right, not a privilege.</p>
